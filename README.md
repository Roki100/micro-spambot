# Micro Spambot
Microsoft Teams SpamBot Browser Script

### Usage:

* Copy the code
* Go to microsoft teams
* Join a meeting/open a chat (conversation) so input field is visble (to type a message) like this: ![img](https://github.com/Roki100/micro-spambot/blob/master/img/1.png?raw=true)
* Open Dev Tools (Ctrl + Shift + I or F12)
* Switch to console if you are not in console
* Paste the code (Remember to edit num and message variable to fit your needs)
* Done!

### To use conversation creation spam script:
* Do the same steps as above but with conversation creation spam script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roki100/micro-spambot/master/conversation_creation_spam.js) and make sure no input field is visble (every converstaion should have "reply" button)
Also make sure you have permissions to make new conversations!\
This script will work in the same way in calls(meetings) as script.js if you have chat open.\
This script just removes the "protection" that script.js has causing it to spam new conversations\
This will look like this: ![img](https://github.com/Roki100/micro-spambot/blob/master/img/2.png?raw=true)
